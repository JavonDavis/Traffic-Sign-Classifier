## German Traffic Sign Classifier

Overview
---
In this project, I created a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. The model was trained and validated with data from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

### Dataset Summary & Exploration

A random image from the training dataset was chosen and plotted to have an idea of what the images look like. Then performed an exploration of the datasets using numpy and python and found out the following:

Training Data

Validtion data
